custom notes are notes the user created locally, rather than notes that have been retrieved from the server. They will only 
remain in this file for as long as they only exist locally, as soon as they're sent to the server they are removed
and placed in to the normal notes file.
userCustomNotes file format is:
{
    _id1: [{..note}, {..note}, {..note}],
    _id2: [{..note}, {..note}, {..note}],
    _id3: [{..note}, {..note}, {..note}],
}

buffered notes are notes that the user has written without an internet connection, and as such are only stored locally.
when the user connects to the internet again, all the buffered notes are sent to the server and removed from buffer
bufferedNotes file format is: 
{
    _id1: [..list of note ids still to be sent to server],
    _id2: [..list of note ids still to be sent to server],
    _id3: [..list of note ids still to be sent to server],
}

CHANGE OF PLAN:
notes will now be their own file, rather than a key to a larger file. cool.
add support for notes that are removed server side. every time a request to update notes is sent, send back a list of all notes that have been removed.
add offline support
